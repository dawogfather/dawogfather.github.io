So about three years ago I made a blog. Not really for you. More so for me. 

To write down important stuff really that I came across day to day that I got stuck on or had to work around or fix or whatever. 

Somewhere along the line that all got too hard and I decided to stop using it and try to continue to use my brain. 

Probably happened somewhere around the time my second child arrived. 

So... Now my second child is almost two and I have another on the way before the years end I thought I may as well give this another go. 

I can't remember much of anything as it is now, so possibly writing things down as they happen is a good idea for when that third child does arrive. 

Hopefully I keep the passwords in the password safe though and not on the blog. 

So what have I been up to besides procreation... Lots of things! 

* setup atebyteapps.com 
* created a site stanthorpevilla.com.au for my brother's rental property
* worked on Madcow 2.0 test automation system
* worked on various insurance domain Guidewire software projects
* played some amateur football and won and lost an elimination final 
* saw that whole nodeJS revolution happen and built a calendar application for my football team as a result (see https://foxpulsecalendar.atebyteapps.com)
* built a new house and fixed up an old rental
* and seen Jose Mourinho come back to Chelsea to win the premiership only to sacked the year after
